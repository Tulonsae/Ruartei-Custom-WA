How to control left and right side timelines

same thing with arrow-left

On chrome-based browsers you can temporarily delete the code that hides [the pop-up] 
Right click the tooltip and go to developer tools > inspect element.
Find a tab called "Event Listeners" and open it
Look for a dropdown menu called "mouseout" and open it
Click 'remove' on all the event listeners.
Voila! The next time you mouse over the tooltip it'll remain up.

In general, everything that has .user-css is pointing towards that main content box
.user-css-extended will point to the comment, meta and other sections below your content
.user-css-map-sidebar will be exactly what it says, the map sidebar
and .user-css-presentation .tooltipster-content will affect the content preview popup for articles

How to target multiple classes:
:is(user-css.map-sidebar, .user-css-sidebar .tab-content, .tooltipster-content, .user-css-presentation) .dropcap {
  font-size: 80px;
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  color: #962626 !important;
}

How to put articles above categories in the TOC list
.user-css .world-menu-subcategory {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column-reverse;
}

This changes the background of the timeline back to whatever-image-you-want 
.timeline-container .horae-list-wrapper {
    background-image: url(insert image url here);
}

And this will hide the right hand navigation:
.timeline-container .horae-list-navigator-wrapper {
display: none;
}

Example of how to limit the anchor tag
.user-css .world-timelines h5 a[href*=chronicle] {
  color: green;
}

.user-css .world-timelines h5 a[href*=timeline] {
  color: blue;
}

How to change where an anchor scrolls to
.user-css h1,
.user-css h2,
.user-css h3,
.user-css h4,
.user-css h5 {
 scroll-margin-top: 50px;
}

Hide entire pop-up on all maps:
.map-context-user-css .leaflet-popup-pane {
 display: none;
}

Hide just the title on all maps:
.map-context-user-css .leaflet-popup-pane .marker-content h5 {
 display: none;
}

Hide entire pop-up on just this map:
.map-f8d3c2ac-9d2f-4e65-98c3-e7ea145c5f4a.map-context-user-css .leaflet-popup-pane {
 display: none;
}

To limit the popup hiding to an individual pin, add a custom class to the pin(s) 'pin-hide-popup' and then add this CSS to your world CSS:
.map-context-user-css .leaflet-marker-pane:has(.pin-hide-popup) + div + .leaflet-popup-pane {
 display: none;
}

How to modify the title on Historical Event Pages
The Title/Header of Historical Entries can be targeted via:
.user-css .justify-content-center h1 {
 background-color: red;
}
This won't affect the Title of articles (they don't use the justify-content-center class).  But it will affect the Title on the Home Page.  So you'll first have to make changes to all h1 elements inside justify-content-center and then "fix" the h1 elements on the Home Page (and maybe another spot I didn't find):
.user-css.page-world-homepage .justify-content-center h1 {
 background-color: white;
}

The character portrait is in the sidebar, which is a separate column in the article template.  So there's a couple ways to proceed.  If you want the entire sidebar on the left side instead of the right on Character articles, then insert this CSS into your World CSS (you can insert this into Article CSS to only affect a single article):
.user-css.template-person .article-content-left {
 float: right;
}

How to make a newsletter style heading
[container:newspaper-header]
  [container:title]
      [h1]Andrawyn Telegraph[/h1]
  [/container]
  [container:date-subline]
      [section: date] [/section]
    [section: subtitle]Issue No. 146 [/section]
  [/container]
[/container]
BB-Code for a global block, I took Footer
.user-css .cover {
height: 160px;
}
.user-css .cover img {
display: none;
}
.user-css .newspaper-header {
    z-index: 1;
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    padding: 2em;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    visibility: visible
}
.newspaper-header .title {
border-top: 3px solid;
border-bottom: 3px solid;
}
.newspaper-header .title h2 {
border: none;
font-size: 5em;
color: black;
border-top: 1px solid black;
border-bottom: 1px solid black;
margin-top: 7px;
padding: 0;
}
.newspaper-header .date-subline {
display: flex;
justify-content: space-between;
}
.newspaper-header .subtitle{
font-weight: 800;
font-variant: small-caps;
font-size: 1.25em;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 1000px) {
.user-css .cover {
height: 200px;
}
.user-css .newspaper-header {
top: 10px;
}
}
@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {
.user-css .title h2 {
font-size: 3em;
}
And the css hiding away the cover image, and placing the custom font-title

for those who haven't thought about this (like me...) if you don't want to have floating images, and are not on the limitation of container stacking (don't ask me why I know that there is a limitation...) you can easily get rid of the [row][col]-stuff, if you define a container with class col-two or col-three or anything and assign the following css: 
.user-css .col-two { 
column-count: 2;
}
` 
Following that, just put your text in the container, and let the browser handle the column-part

Is there any way with CSS to make it so that the Related Historical Events are on one line (Date then link) instead of two?
(From Rin) To give an option in addition to what Buzzard has (there are probably several ways to do this, and I'm curious to compare a few of them), you can use a grid:
.user-css .related-historical-entry {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: max-content auto;
}
(From Buzzard) You'll have to adjust a little to fit your existing theme.
.user-css .panel .related-historical-entry-date {
 float: left;
 padding-right: 6px;
 clear: left;
}
In my theme, the dates are a little smaller.  So if that's the case, you may need to adjust the font-size some.
(From Han) I would always avoid using floats for layout. They're for images in text only, these days. Floats for layout are pretty outdated and don't work well with adapting to mobile or other screen sizes.

I can't figure out how to get this to work, so does anyone either already have code or an answer to how to column out the tagged articles list when its in blocks? I can get it to column but it puts two blocks in the first column before going to the second column. I'm trying to get it to be three columns if I have a smaller list of tagged articles.
Give this a try:
.user-css .tagged-articles-list {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 20px;
    grid-auto-rows: minmax(0px, auto);
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    align-items: start;
}

From Tillerz:
Some stuff could also need some additional css classes, like the boards. Or if you want an article to look the same in article view and in the mouseover popup, you have to use something complicated like 
:is(.user-css-presentation .tooltipster-base .tooltipster-box .tooltipster-content, .user-css) { ... } 
 in front. And then you'd also need to add some classes for the map sidebar, too ... 

From Rin
having images be desaturated until hovered is pretty simple.
.user-css img {
  filter: saturate(.5);
}
.user-css img:hover {
  filter: saturate(1);
}

.user-css-presentation {
    background-size: cover;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-position: center;
}

From Han:
I was wondering if there was a code to change the color of the background of the World Codex list that pops up on the left hand side, I want mine to be black and have the header gold and the text white.
.user-css-presentation #world-navigation-sidebar {
  background: var(--background-colour);
}
Similarly, the button that opens it can be changed with:
.user-css-presentation .world-navigation-palette-trigger {
  background: var(--background-colour);
  color: var(--text-colour-secondary);
}

.user-css-presentation .world-navigation-palette-trigger:hover {
  background: var(--background-colour);
  color: var(--text-colour-secondary-hover);
}
